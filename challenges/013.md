# Stake Wars: Episode III. Challenge 013

- Published on: 2022-08-11
- Updated on: 2022-08-11
- Submitted by: Everstake
- Rewards: 25 UNP & 10 DNP

## Description

In this challenge, participants will learn how to update their node, migrate keys, and set up a **BACKUP** node. 

Please note that this challenge includes multiple parts: 
- **Best Practices**: is an informational section that outlines the optimal way of updating a validator node (no points) 
- **Task**: in this section, participants will learn how to migrate validator keys. Only this part of the challenge will be evaluated.  (25 UNP & 10 DNP)  

## Acceptance Criteria

- Run a backup node
- Successfully migrate validator keys from the **MAIN** node to the **BACKUP** node

## Challenge submission

For submission, please fill out the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZV6_SUpdAMlOOjpwQSVa0xUcvCjO5iiNG3k9KrGDvCEEw3w/viewform?usp=sf_link)  

To submit your results, make sure to include the following: 

Please include a screenshot of logs that shows that the `public_key` has been changed on the main & backup node and timestamps from the validator and backup nodes.

## Best Practices

**Before updating your node, make sure that you have checked**

1. An official announcement for the update.
2. Release Notes on GitHub.  
Be aware of *DB migration or other breaking changes*
3. Validator chats.  
Review *how many validators have been updated?  
Were there any noticeable problems?*
4. Update testnet/backup node.   
*Spend some time testing it on your backup node before moving to the main validator node.* 


⚠️ **We recommend that you keep the previous versions of compiled binaries in case of an urgent downgrade**


### Update binary

- Create a new directory, e.g `sources` & *clone* or *update* `nearcore` project from GitHub

```bash
cd sources
git clone https://github.com/near/nearcore
cd nearcore
git fetch origin --tags
```

- Checkout to the branch you need. The latest unstable release is recommended if you are running on the **testnet** or **shardnet** and the latest stable version is recommended if you are running on the **mainnet**. Please check the [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/near/nearcore/releases).

```bash
git checkout <version>
```

- Compile `nearcore` binary

```bash
make release
```

```bash
./target/release/neard --version
```


⚠️ **Don’t forget to check the version and hash of the binary, it should be the same as displayed on [releases page](https://github.com/near/nearcore/releases)**


- Replace binary in your work directory

```bash
cp ./target/release/neard <WORK_DIR>/bin/
```

- Restart the node and check the log file

## Task

*Try to use different folders for binaries & sources for version check*

### Backup node

In case of missed blocks or chunks, the validator can be removed from the active validation set in the next auction. If you want to secure your validator NEAR node from a high downtime, you can deploy a **backup** server with the preconfigured NEAR node. Having two provisioned nodes allows you to quickly switch from one server to another by migrating your validator keys, so you can continue producing blocks with minimal downtime. If the nearcore release has long database migration, or you must maintain/scale the server, we also recommend migrating your validator keys to the backup node. 

Always analyze your node activities and be ready to determine a problem and move the *main validator* keys to the **backup** node. 

### Validator keys migration

Firstly, you need to have a backup server, a NEAR node with a new `node_key.json` and one more generated `validator_key.json`. To switch quickly, prepare folders for the validator keys and reserve keys 


⚠️ **Be careful! Don't let two nodes run with the same keys!  
This will make your node slashed. This means that your node will be excluded from the active validation set and your funds may be burnt.**


If the server is **unavailable** (e.g. no network connection) deal with the hosting provider, get access and **only** then start the key migration procedure! Always make sure that the **MAIN** node doesn’t work 

If the server is **available**

1. Stop the **MAIN** node
2. Make sure the **MAIN** node isn’t working

```bash
ps aux | grep neard
netstat -tlpn | grep neard
```

3. Replace main validator keys on the **MAIN** node with the reserve ones (optional, if you are sure the node won’t start accidentally)

```bash
cd mainnet
rm validator_key.json node_key.json
cp ../<RESERVE_KEYS>/validator_key.json ../<RESERVE_KEYS>/node_key.json .
```

4. Stop the **BACKUP** node
5. Make sure the **BACKUP** node isn’t working

```bash
ps aux | grep neard
netstat -tlpn | grep neard
```

6. Replace reserve keys on the **BACKUP** node with main validator 

```bash
cd mainnet
rm validator_key.json node_key.json
cp ../<VALIDATOR_KEYS>/validator_key.json ../<VALIDATOR_KEYS>/node_key.json .
```

7. Check the `validator_key.json` and `node_key.json`

You can check file identity using `md5sum` command for `validator_state.json` and `node_key.json` on both nodes. If the checksums match, then the files are identical.

Or you use `diff` command

```bash
diff <WORK_DIR>/mainnet/validator_key.json ../<RESERVE_KEYS>/validator_key.json
diff <WORK_DIR>/mainnet/node_key.json ../<RESERVE_KEYS>/node_key.json

diff <WORK_DIR>/mainnet/validator_key.json ../<VALIDATOR_KEYS>/validator_key.json
diff <WORK_DIR>/mainnet/node_key.json ../<VALIDATOR_KEYS>/node_key.json
```

8. Start the **BACKUP** node

After starting the node in the log, you **used to see** the line with `peer_id` that was equal to `public_key` in `/<WORK_DIR>/mainnet/node_key.json` & `../<VALIDATOR_KEYS>/node_key.json`, **but now just make sure that your backup node is validating**. 
In the logs of the **BACKUP** node you should see "Validator |"
