    "### Goal: check diversification of actual stakers on mainnet\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to minimize risk, it would be expected that stakers diversify their portfolio of validators by staking their staked NEAR with different validators. If one validator performs badly the staker then only loses a part of their staking rewards. I would therefore like to check if current stakers on mainnet actually act according to this principle. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected result\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis is that stakers actually do not care a lot about risk diversification and that most of the stakers place their stake with only one validator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement of diversification\n",
    "\n",
    "In a first simplified approach, diversification can be measured by counting the number of validators one staker has staked with. The higher the count, the higher the diversification. A more elaborate approach would be also taking into account the actual distribution of their stake. A staker who stakes with two validators for 50% each has arguably a higher diversification than a staker who stakes with three validators but has a distribution of 90% / 5% / 5%.\n",

    "## Data acquisition\n",
